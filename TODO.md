# CORS Fix Progress

## Completed âœ…
- [x] Added `django-cors-headers>=4.3.1` to requirements.txt
- [x] Updated CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS in settings.py to include port 3001
- [x] Installed dependencies (django-cors-headers was already installed)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Restart Django development server to apply CORS changes
- [ ] Test login functionality to verify CORS error is resolved
- [ ] Verify other API endpoints work correctly with CORS

## Changes Made
1. **requirements.txt**: Added django-cors-headers package
2. **training_tracker/settings.py**: Added `http://localhost:3001` and `http://127.0.0.1:3001` to CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Login request to `/api/token/` works without CORS errors
- [ ] Other API endpoints work correctly
- [ ] Preflight requests are handled properly
